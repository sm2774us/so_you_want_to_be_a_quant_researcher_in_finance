# so_you_want_to_be_a_quant_researcher_in_finance

Becoming a successful quantitative researcher in a multi-strategy buy-side hedge fund requires a deep and broad skill set, covering both technical and domain-specific knowledge. Although mastering all of these areas in a week is highly ambitious, I can help you create a structured, focused plan that covers the essentials of each topic. The goal is to expose you to the foundational concepts, so you can later dive deeper as needed.
