# Day 6: Compliance, Risk, and Regulations

#### Overview
On Day 6, we will explore compliance, risk, and regulations in the financial industry. This includes understanding the frameworks governing trading activities, risk assessment methods, and statistical models used in compliance analysis. We will also cover relevant code implementations in Python and C++.

---

### **1. Compliance and Regulatory Frameworks**

#### **1.1 Key Regulations**
- **Basel III**: A global regulatory framework focusing on bank capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk.
- **MiFID II**: Enhances transparency and investor protection in financial markets.
- **Dodd-Frank Act**: Introduced post-2008 financial crisis, focusing on reducing risks in the financial system.

#### **1.2 Compliance Requirements**
- Regular reporting of risk exposure
- Transparency in trades
- Adherence to market conduct rules

### **2. Risk Assessment Models**

#### **2.1 Risk Types**
- **Market Risk**: Risk of losses due to market movements.
- **Credit Risk**: Risk of loss from a counterparty defaulting.
- **Operational Risk**: Risks arising from internal processes or systems failures.

#### **2.2 Value at Risk (VaR) in Compliance**
VaR is often used in compliance to ensure firms hold enough capital against potential losses.

- **Parametric VaR Formula**:
```math
\text{VaR}_{\alpha} = \mu - z_{\alpha} \sigma
```
Where:
- $$\mu$$: Mean return
- $$\sigma$$: Standard deviation
- $$z_{\alpha}$$: z-score corresponding to confidence level $$\alpha$$

**Python Code Example** (Calculating VaR):
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import norm

# Sample returns data
returns = pd.Series(np.random.normal(0.01, 0.02, 1000))

def calculate_var(returns, confidence_level=0.95):
    mean = returns.mean()
    std_dev = returns.std()
    z_score = norm.ppf(confidence_level)
    var = mean - z_score * std_dev
    return var

var = calculate_var(returns)
print(f'Value at Risk (VaR): {var}')
```

**C++ Code Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <boost/math/distributions/normal.hpp>

double calculate_var(const Eigen::VectorXd& returns, double confidence_level) {
    double mean = returns.mean();
    double std_dev = std::sqrt((returns.array() - mean).square().mean());
    double z_score = boost::math::quantile(boost::math::normal(), confidence_level);
    return mean - z_score * std_dev;
}

int main() {
    Eigen::VectorXd returns(1000);
    returns = Eigen::VectorXd::Random(1000) * 0.02 + 0.01; // Simulated returns

    double var = calculate_var(returns, 0.95);
    std::cout << "Value at Risk (VaR): " << var << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **3. Statistical Compliance Testing**

#### **3.1 Stress Testing**
Stress testing assesses how a firmâ€™s portfolio performs under extreme conditions.

- **Stress Testing Methodology**:
1. Identify risk factors.
2. Define stress scenarios.
3. Assess the impact on the portfolio.

#### **3.2 Scenario Analysis**
Scenario analysis examines potential future events by considering alternative possible outcomes.

**Python Code Example** (Basic Stress Testing):
```python
def stress_test(returns, stress_factor):
    stressed_returns = returns * stress_factor
    return stressed_returns.mean(), stressed_returns.std()

mean_stress, std_stress = stress_test(returns, 0.8)
print(f'Stressed Mean: {mean_stress}, Stressed Std Dev: {std_stress}')
```

**C++ Code Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense>

std::pair<double, double> stress_test(const Eigen::VectorXd& returns, double stress_factor) {
    Eigen::VectorXd stressed_returns = returns * stress_factor;
    double mean = stressed_returns.mean();
    double std_dev = std::sqrt((stressed_returns.array() - mean).square().mean());
    return {mean, std_dev};
}

int main() {
    Eigen::VectorXd returns = Eigen::VectorXd::Random(1000) * 0.02 + 0.01; // Simulated returns
    auto [mean_stress, std_stress] = stress_test(returns, 0.8);
    std::cout << "Stressed Mean: " << mean_stress << ", Stressed Std Dev: " << std_stress << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **4. Questions & Answers Section**

#### **Q1: What is the purpose of Value at Risk (VaR) in financial compliance?**
**A1:** VaR is used to quantify the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence level. It ensures firms maintain adequate capital reserves against potential losses, aligning with regulatory requirements.

#### **Q2: Explain how stress testing works.**
**A2:** Stress testing involves assessing a portfolio's performance under extreme market conditions by applying predefined stress factors to the returns. It helps evaluate the resilience of the portfolio to adverse scenarios.

#### **Q3: Write a Python function to conduct a basic stress test on a return series.**
**A3:**
```python
def stress_test(returns, stress_factor):
    stressed_returns = returns * stress_factor
    return stressed_returns.mean(), stressed_returns.std()

mean_stress, std_stress = stress_test(returns, 0.8)
print(f'Stressed Mean: {mean_stress}, Stressed Std Dev: {std_stress}')
```

#### **Q4: How do regulations like Basel III impact risk management practices?**
**A4:** Basel III establishes stricter capital requirements, encourages better risk management practices, and enhances transparency in financial reporting. It aims to improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress.
